<h1>Studying</h1>
<h2>Notes on Studying and my Study Plan</h2>
<p>Some folks have asked me about how I study.</p>
<p>Most of the good studying habits I have developed have matured out of an
extremely fortunate post-16 school experience, and a summer-long sprint through
a semester's worth of MIT OpenCourseWare material.</p>
<p>Remember that this is <em>my</em> study plan - another cannot so easily acquire a
right to it. The whole point of learning is figuring out good long-term
strategies for becoming more skillful and capable, which is something you only
do by doing it. Until you have experimented empirically, you do not know how to
study.</p>
<p>The structure of the plan is given by a great guide for undergraduate math
courses available <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/math41/jasp.html">here</a>. This
is generalised and extended mostly with the book 'A Mind for Numbers' by
Barbara Oakley, which is the single best informational resource on
metalearning, nevermind the maths the title pigeonholes it into.</p>
<p>This post does not discuss the actual most important element of good,
consistent study and work, which is mental and physical wellness; the ability
to 'preserve oneself'. In my opinion, the real personal value of formal
education such as university is not that you learn things, but that you have a
sandbox to apply and evaluate different ideas over several years. Talk to the
interesting people around you, experiment with different approaches to doing
things, and trust the response you get from reality. I cannot tell you how to
stay well because I am not you, but I don't think it's as complex and opaque as
it is made out to be.</p>
<p>I'll give you some knowledge that has helped me - obesity and mental health
problems are on the rise at a societal scale. There are things everyone takes
for granted that are extremely damaging to the body and the mind that inhabits
it - there is no need to inherit this. Drink water, eat well, be outside,
exercise regularly, and get rest. These 5 things literally transformed the way
that I think, and they're the most stupid, simple, obvious place to start. Just
living well and paying attention can provide a lot of meaning all on its own.</p>

ready-made souls!" - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry</p>
<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<p>Some of you will look at the plan below and think, "that is
overkill". Depending on the course, you're absolutely correct. After returning
to my actual university course after a stint doing an MIT workload, the amount
of effort required was as much as an order of magnitude less than what is
described below. That said, it was <em>only just</em> enough to keep up over a few MIT
classes, so it is a system I am glad to have in full.</p>
<p>Since in the general case this plan is indeed overkill, I've put what I believe are
the most important ideas here.</p>
<h5>Identify Important Information</h5>
<p>This may seem obvious and vague, but is
seriously lacking among many students, in part because of the presentation of
material in lectures and coursebooks. Become briefly familiar with a few
fundamental ideas before a lecture - glance through your textbook for 5 to 10
minutes and get a grasp on ideas in subheadings and bold text. In all
likelihood a majority of your capability in the subject is tied up in being
able to apply the concepts that pop out at you from this process, so give
yourself the headstart of knowing what these things are.</p>
<p>Additionally, you will be taught things that are next to useless. Things that
you may even be graded on, but are boring and stupid.  Remember them, and don't
spend a moment more of your energy than you have to in order to learn them.
Becoming capable at identifying their importance upfront frees up a lot of
energy over time.</p>
<h5>Actively Engage</h5>
<p>There is no such thing as passive learning. There is no
such thing as passive learning. There is no such thing as passive learning. Do
not be the person who knows everything about kung fu and cannot throw a punch.
You will get beaten up, and it will be deserved. When faculty talks about this
it is usually in the context of "asking questions" etc. It is true that you
should be talking with interesting people about interesting ideas <em>a lot</em>. Even
more important is to garner actual hands-on practical experience with your
trade. This is the difference between knowledge and skill. Unless your job is
walking encyclopedia, domain-specific knowledge is only useful as a supplement
to the ability to act.</p>
<h5>Be Habitual</h5>
<p>90% of the pain students undergo comes from
inefficient balancing of workload. All of the complaining about difficult
assignments begins the week before it is due. The most disappointed students
after an exam were the ones that should have aced it with minimal effort, but
never did short yet regular study. When you really get into the groove of work
it doesn't really have any mental overhead, but cramming is literally
self-torture for a tenth of the gain. Have fun and experiment with how you do
things, find what works well and especially what doesn't in the long term, do
what makes sense moment by moment, and you will be unstoppable within maybe
just a year or two.</p>
<h3>Study Plan</h3>
<h5>BEFORE a lecture - skim relevant section in text book (~10 mins).</h5>
<p>This orients your perspective even if your understanding is cursory, as you
begin to identify the things that are most important to understand. Look for
phrases in headings, images, bold text, and words and notation that keeps
popping up. Recommended to do before a lecture such that you have enough time to
look up anything that looks like the textbook takes for granted. This seriously
reduces the number of lectures that are too fast or totally baffling, as well
as the number of lectures that are boring and over-long.</p>
<h5>DURING a lecture - take notes as if for a friend, and ask questions.</h5>
<p>Notes aren't written for yourself, but for your future self, who <em>may not know
as much as you do</em>! When you write as though a friend who didn't take the
lecture should be able to know what the core ideas were, you structure better
and consider what needs to be included for a more complete understanding. By
the way, don't underestimate the power of a well structured first draft - part
of the remembering process is not just of what was written, but where and how
it was written, literally how it is laid out on the page is tied to your memory
of the concept. This is a hook to improve your knowledge.</p>
<p>"Asking questions" I'm not going to spend much time on, but if you know what you
need to ask then ask it as soon as you can, you only get so much in person
contact time. The fact that you can ask academics questions and expect replies
is what almost all of a degree's expenses are going towards, and is the most
valuable asset you can leverage.</p>
<h5>JUST AFTER a lecture - review notes and compare (~10 mins).</h5>
<p>Skim your notes shortly to consider how the ideas in the lecture relate to one
another - do ideas from the end of the lecture give context to ideas from the
start of the lecture? Here you are knitting together the whole thing to get a
better idea of the big picture. Then discuss the ideas with other students and
consider their notes - this fills in gaps you may not have realised existed.</p>
<h5>SAME DAY AS lecture - edit and summarise notes (~20 mins).</h5>
<p>Think of this as the draft copy of the text vs. the edited copy. Your goal
should be to try and fit all the major concepts of the lecture into no more
than 1/2 a page of A4 paper, through any means you can think of. At this time
you also would like to relate them to other ideas you have learnt so far, so
this exercise seriously forces you to engage with the absolutely most essential
elements. Something I often hear during written assignments with word limits is
that students just "can't make it any shorter". Invariably this has been
false, but it does show that this is a skill that requires practice.</p>
<h5>BEFORE NEXT lecture - do practical hands on learning (at least 1 hour).</h5>
<p>This is the part that actually matters. Repeat after me - there is no such
thing as passive learning. And there is also no point to simply "knowing
things". If you are not using ideas to make cool things and solve cool
problems, they are probably not particularly useful ideas, or you do not know
them well enough.</p>
<h5>SAME WEEK AS lecture - turn notes into flashcards.</h5>
<p>Classical flashcards are boring, but they are a vast improvement over other
traditional forms of rote memorisation, because they're not <em>that</em> boring. This
section is almost misnomered, as the real value they represent is not in the
act of writing and going through flashcards, but in spaced repetition, which is
the best method to make sure you will definitely know the things you repeat. Don't
flashcard everything though - we want to spend most of our time outside of class
actually doing interesting things. Focus instead on "things you just have to
know", and hard problems that you really want to go through several times. This
latter category is incredibly powerful with spaced repetition, because you're
not just learning the tools required to solve such problems, but how they are
used together.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>Many thanks to Olivier Szymanezyk and Charles Fox for all they have done over
the past few years. Time spent with them has been incalculably valuable and
made everything possible.</p>
